Content Translation System allows you to publish your content in more than one language and make your website "Multilingual". You can translate most content scopes easily by Content Translation System. e.g. Blog Posts, Blog Categories, Pages, Modules and others.<br/>
You can start translating contents on <a href="index.php?pack=language" target="_blank">Languages Management</a>.

<b>Note: </b>Content Translation System needs "content::translate" Plug-in to be enabled or your contents will not be translated.

<b>Note: </b>It's recommended to enable Caching system when using Content Translation System.
