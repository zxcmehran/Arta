S_S_PLUGIN_CENSORSHIP_BAD_WORDS_L=Bad words
S_S_PLUGIN_CENSORSHIP_BAD_WORDS_D=These bad words will be censored from your website content. You should separate them with "," delimeter. <br/>If you type 'dog', all words containing the string 'dog' would be censored ('dogma', for instance, would appear as '***ma'). To censor more accurately, you can require that censors occur only for exact words. You can do this by placing a censor word in curly braces, as in '{dog}'.
